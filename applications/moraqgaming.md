# Moraq Gaming: Decentralized Prediction Market on Polkadot

## üåü Project Overview

Moraq Gaming is a decentralized prediction market built on the Polkadot ecosystem that allows users to make simple price predictions on cryptocurrencies, earning rewards for correct forecasts while enjoying a seamless, gamified experience.

Our platform offers an intuitive way to predict cryptocurrency price movements in short time frames (5-minute rounds), enabling users to earn rewards for correct predictions while participating in an engaging, game-like experience that builds community and rewards market insight.

We're building on Polkadot because its cross-chain architecture, robust security model, and growing ecosystem make it the ideal foundation for our prediction platform. The Polkadot ecosystem currently lacks a dedicated, user-friendly prediction market, and we aim to fill this gap while creating new utility for DOT and parachain tokens.

Our team is passionate about bringing accessible DeFi experiences to everyday users, and we believe prediction markets represent an engaging entry point that combines entertainment with real utility.

### üîç Project Details

#### Technology Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Substrate-based smart contracts written in ink!
- **Frontend**: React.js with Polkadot.js integration
- **Data Feeds**: ChainLink / pyth oracle integration for price feeds

#### Core Components
1. **Prediction Contract**
   - Manages round creation, user entries, and result calculation
   - Handles prize pool collection and distribution
   - Implements transparent outcome verification

2. **Oracle Integration**
   - Secure price feed integration from reliable sources
   - Tamper-proof price verification mechanism

3. **User Interface**
   - Mobile-optimized, responsive web application
   - Real-time price charts and countdown timers
   - One-click UP/DOWN prediction buttons
   - History panel for tracking performance

#### User Experience Flow
1. Connect Polkadot wallet
2. Select prediction direction (UP/DOWN)
3. Choose prediction amount
4. Monitor live round progress
5. Receive automatic rewards for correct predictions

#### Mockups
We have developed initial UI mockups for the core prediction interface:
- Main prediction screen with UP/DOWN buttons and timer
- History panel showing past predictions and results
- Wallet connection and balance display
- Leaderboard view for competitive users

#### Limitations
Moraq Gaming will **not**:
- Offer complex derivative products or leverage
- Support prediction markets for non-crypto assets initially
- Provide custodial services for user funds
- Include custom token issuance in initial release

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

#### Ecosystem Position
Moraq Gaming fills a significant gap in the Polkadot ecosystem by providing a dedicated prediction market platform. While DeFi applications are growing on Polkadot, accessible, gamified prediction markets remain underdeveloped. We leverage Polkadot's security, interoperability, and growing user base while creating new utility for DOT and parachain tokens.

#### Target Audience
- Existing Polkadot token holders seeking new ways to engage with their assets
- DeFi users interested in prediction markets
- Crypto enthusiasts who enjoy gamified financial experiences
- New users attracted by the platform's accessibility and game-like interface

#### Addressing Needs
Moraq Gaming meets the following ecosystem needs:
- Creating additional utility for DOT and parachain tokens
- Providing an accessible entry point to DeFi for new users
- Offering an engaging, game-like experience that builds community
- Increasing on-chain activity through prediction transactions

#### Similar Projects
While prediction markets exist on other blockchains (Polymarket, Augur, etc.), the Polkadot ecosystem currently lacks a dedicated, user-friendly prediction platform. Existing Polkadot DeFi platforms focus primarily on lending, staking, and AMMs, leaving the prediction market niche largely unfilled.
